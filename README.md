# SinglyLinkedLists
In this section, we introduce a data structure known as a linked list, which provides
an alternative to an array-based structure. A linked list, in its simplest form,
is a collection of nodes that collectively form a linear sequence. In a singly linked
list, each node stores a reference to an object that is an element of the sequence, as
well as a reference to the next node of the list
Minimally, the linked list instance must keep a reference to the first
node of the list, known as the head. Without an explicit reference to the head,
there would be no way to locate that node (or indirectly, any others). The last
node of the list is known as the tail. The tail of a list can be found by traversing the
linked list—starting at the head and moving from one node to another by following
each node’s next reference.
